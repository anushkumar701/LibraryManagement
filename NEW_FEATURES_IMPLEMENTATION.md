## 🗄️ Database Setup Required

Run this SQL to add the new table:

```sql
-- Book Transactions Table
CREATE TABLE book_transactions (
    transactionid SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    bookid INTEGER NOT NULL REFERENCES books(bookid) ON DELETE CASCADE,
    userid INTEGER NOT NULL REFERENCES libraryuser(userid) ON DELETE CASCADE,
    borrow_date TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    return_date TIMESTAMP,
    status VARCHAR(20) NOT NULL CHECK (status IN ('borrowed', 'returned')),
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);

-- Indexes for Performance
CREATE INDEX idx_transactions_bookid ON book_transactions(bookid);
CREATE INDEX idx_transactions_userid ON book_transactions(userid);
CREATE INDEX idx_transactions_status ON book_transactions(status);
```

**Note:** This SQL is already added to `database_setup.sql` file.
